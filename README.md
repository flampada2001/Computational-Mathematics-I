# Computational Mathematics I
This repository contains the solutuons to projects 1, 2 and 3 that were assigned during the __Comutational Mathematics I (Numerical Analysis)__ classes. Directory __'Prompts'__ contains the __promts of each project__, directory __'Code'___ contains the __Jupyter notebooks__ that were made to answer said prompts and directory __'Reports'__ contains the reports presenting the results of each project.

__Note: Project 1 did not require a detailed report like the other two projects. Therefore, Report 1 is simply a printed version of the first notebook.__
